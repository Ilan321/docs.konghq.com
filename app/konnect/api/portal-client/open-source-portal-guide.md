## Why?

Customers are able to integrate portal management operations with their automation systems (such as CI/CD pipelines) by utilizing a refactored and newly-published AIP-compliant Portal Management API.

Note that, although many of the global portal settings mentioned above are traditionally configured once and then not changed, we are designing for a more dynamic future where multiple portals may be created and destroyed with automation and potentially at scale, which will necessitate API operations.


## Portal Settings
Appearance and basic customization of the portal sent from using the portal
Enable and configure third-party SSO
Enable and configure third-party dynamic client registration (DCR)
Set public or private portal access
Hosting options and custom domain configuration

## Developer and Application Registration management
List and manage developers registered to use the portal
Enable and manage role-based access control (RBAC) for developers
Approve and decline developer and app-reg requests, or optionally enable auto-approval for these operations

## Use Case - Set up a basic dev portal and tear it down quickly (like a demo environment?)
